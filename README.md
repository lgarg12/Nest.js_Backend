# Nest.js_Backend

For running the backend run following command
1. npm i 
2. npm run start:dev


To achieve easy setup of the database with a single migration command or script, you can follow these steps:

1. First, make sure you have Node.js installed.(Version 22.1.0) Then, install the NestJS CLI globally 

npm install -g @nestjs/cli

2. Initialize Prisma in your project by running:

npx prisma init

3. In the schema.prisma file generated by Prisma, configure your database settings. For example, if you're using SQLite, your datasource configuration might look like this:

datasource db {
  provider = "sqlite"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

4. Replace DATABASE_URL with the URL of your database. If you're using PostgreSQL, the URL format would be like this:

postgres://YourUserName:YourPassword@YourHostname:5432/YourDatabaseName

Make sure to enter the correct database URL.

5. Install the Prisma Client generator:

npm install @prisma/client

6. Create your database schema and models. Prisma will generate a Prisma Client for interacting with your database based on your schema. Ensure you're using Node.js version 22.1.0, as specified.
Once your schema is set up, run the following command to create and apply migrations to your database:

prisma migrate dev

This command will create the necessary migrations and apply them to your database.

Verify that your database has been created or updated with the changes from the migrations.
Finally, you can proceed to write your CRUD operations for your REST API using NestJS, utilizing the Prisma Client to interact with the database.
